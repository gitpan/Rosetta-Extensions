PREFACE

This distribution has reference implementations of fundamental Rosetta features.

See the various POD and PM files in this distribution, and their references,
starting with Rosetta::Extensions, for all your documentation needs.  The
distribution also includes a ChangeLog file to say what changes already
happened, and a TODO file to say what changes have yet to happen.  The file
INSTALL should help with installation issues.  Read below for how to get support
or keep up to date, know this distribution's dependencies, or read the credits
or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.006

Standard Modules: none

Nonstandard Modules: 

	Rosetta 0.35
	DBI 1.42
	various DBI Driver (DBD) modules

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

None besides myself so far.

is accompanied by a complete copy of the source code of Rosetta::Extensions
(the version of Rosetta::Extensions used to produce the combined work), being

module is a module which is not derived from or based on Rosetta::Extensions,
and which is fully useable when not linked to Rosetta::Extensions in any form.

Any versions of Rosetta::Extensions that you modify and distribute must carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other
