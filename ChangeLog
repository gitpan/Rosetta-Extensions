	* Release 0.01.

	* This is the first release of the Rosetta-Extensions distribution.  This
	distribution is meant to be temporary, collecting a number of related
	modules during their infancy, as they tend to be updated in tandem; said
	modules will get split into their own distributions later when they
	stabilize.  This release features the first versions of the modules
	Rosetta::Engine::Generic and Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder (plus the
	placeholder Rosetta::Extensions and the localization file
	Rosetta::Engine::L::en).  These modules are mostly code complete such that
	you can connect to or disconnect from databases, as well as create or
	remove tables and sequences in a database.  None of this functionality was
	tested, though (except for compiling); that is planned for release 0.03.
	
	* For more background information, see the "Rosetta" distribution and 
	everything of mine that it references.
