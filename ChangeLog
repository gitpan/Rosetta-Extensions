	* Release 0.02.

	* This is a "middle of development" release that includes a large number of
	changes, some of which are only partially implemented.  It exists largely
	so that I can have a reliable backup for (and historical record of) the
	last 3 weeks of in-progress work.  It compiles, but there are large gaps.

	* Updated external dependencies on SQL::SyntaxModel to v0.17.

	* Updated all relevant documentation, including the NAME of Extensions.pod,
	to specify that the modules herein are "reference implementations of
	fundamental Rosetta features".  That is, they are not meant to be the best
	or only implementations, but rather just examples of how the deed is done.

	* Updated documentation to say that the SQL-2003 standard is now the focus 
	of influence rather than SQL-1999 (or SQL-1992).

	* Updated SQLBuilder.pm (now v0.02) extensively such that over 70% of the
	module was added or rewritten; probably 98%+ of all changes for this
	distribution release were in this module.  Most existing properties and
	methods were renamed and/or reordered.  Added 2 base properties and 4 'data
	types' sub-properties.  The 'data types' sub-property defaults are now more
	standard-centric rather than MySQL centric; said sub-properties can now
	contain substitution variables.  Implemented most of the SQL generation
	code corresponding to these sections of "SQL-2003 Foundation": 5 "Lexical
	elements", 6 "Scalar expressions", 7 "Query expressions", 8 "Predicates",
	11 "Schema definition and manipulation".  All of the above concerned code 
	changes.  For documentation, there were no descriptions for individual 
	functions/methods in 0.01, but now there are for about a third of them.

	* Updated Generic.pm (now v0.02) so that the "engine configuration option"
	named "insen_ident" (case-insensitive identifiers) was renamed to
	"delim_ident" (delimited identifiers); rewrote that option's description.

	* Updated en.pm (now v0.02) to add a "ROS_G_RAW_SQLSTATE" message.

	* Release 0.01.

	* This is the first release of the Rosetta-Extensions distribution.  This
	distribution is meant to be temporary, collecting a number of related
	modules during their infancy, as they tend to be updated in tandem; said
	modules will get split into their own distributions later when they
	stabilize.  This release features the first versions of the modules
	Rosetta::Engine::Generic and Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder (plus the
	placeholder Rosetta::Extensions and the localization file
	Rosetta::Engine::L::en).  These modules are mostly code complete such that
	you can connect to or disconnect from databases, as well as create or
	remove tables and sequences in a database.  None of this functionality was
	tested, though (except for compiling); that is planned for release 0.03.

	* For more background information, see the "Rosetta" distribution and 
	everything of mine that it references.
